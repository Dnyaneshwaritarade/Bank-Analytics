# Bank-Analytics
Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of bank loan data to monitor and assess lending activities and performance. Utilizing SQL, Power BI, and Excel for ETL processes, and Tableau for visualization, the project aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Key Highlights
ETL Processes: Utilized SQL, Power BI, and Excel for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes to integrate and clean data.
Initial Data Analysis: Analyzed key variables such as loan amounts, interest rates, customer demographics, and loan terms using statistical methods and data visualization techniques to provide initial insights into the dataset.
Loan Performance Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of loan performance over time to uncover patterns in loan delinquency and repayment behavior.
Interactive Dashboards: Created and maintained interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to visualize key metrics, enabling real-time data exploration and decision-making for stakeholders.
Dashboard Highlights
Summary Dashboard:

Total Loan Applications: Calculated the total number of loan applications received during specified periods, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
Total Funded Amount: Monitored the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with an analysis of MTD and MoM changes.
Total Amount Received: Tracked the total amount received from borrowers, assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD and MoM changes.
Average Interest Rate: Calculated the average interest rate across all loans MTD and monitored MoM variations.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluated the average DTI for borrowers, computing MTD values and tracking MoM fluctuations.
Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs:

Good Loans: Assessed metrics such as Good Loan Application Percentage, total applications, funded amount, and total received amount for loans classified as 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
Bad Loans: Calculated metrics such as Bad Loan Application Percentage, total applications, funded amount, and total received amount for loans classified as 'Charged Off.'
Loan Status Grid View:

Provided a comprehensive overview of lending operations categorized by loan status, analyzing metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.
Overview Dashboard:

Monthly Trends (Line Chart): Showcased variations in Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received over time.
Regional Analysis (Filled Map): Represented lending metrics by state.
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Depicted loan statistics based on different loan terms.
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Illustrated lending metrics among borrowers with different employment lengths.
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Provided a breakdown of loan metrics based on loan purposes.
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Displayed loan metrics categorized by home ownership statuses.
Details Dashboard:

Offered a consolidated view of essential information within loan data, serving as a user-friendly interface for accessing detailed insights into the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
Tools and Technologies
SQL: Utilized for querying the database, data manipulation, and extracting insights.
Power BI: Used for creating interactive reports and dashboards.
Excel: Employed for data cleaning, preliminary analysis, and additional data visualizations.
